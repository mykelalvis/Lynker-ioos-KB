Availability is a transient attribute indicating accessibility by [[audience|valid consumers]].

A service, platform, or artifact may or may not be available.

If it is available, then it is in a place where it could be accessed by a valid consumer.

If it is unavailable, then it has become (or possibly was never) accessible by its consumer base.

Note that as a transient attribute, availability will come and go depending on internal and external factors.

For instance, if AWS goes down and your application is hosted on AWS, then it has become inaccessible.  You might need to do
something to rectify this, or you might need to do nothing, waiting until AWS recovers.
