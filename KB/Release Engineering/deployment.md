Deployment
===

<dl>
<dt>deployment</dt>
<dd>(n.) induced availability of an artifact in an environment</dd>
</dl>

Deploying (aka "doing a deploy" or "doing a deployment" [sic] ) is the process by which some version of an [[artifact]] becomes [[availability|available]] to its intended [[audience]].  This might be a service running in AWS, or it might be a tag in GitHub for a library, or it might be a RubyGem deployed to a GemStore ( a type of [[artifact repository]]).

Deployment is typically the most human-intensive of the automatable processes that a build and release process defines.  Frequently there are human interventions that need to be performed to enable progress.

The goal of a good automated release engineering process is to reduce the number and frequency of those interventions.
The hopeful target of this is reduction to zero, where the entire process can be automated.
