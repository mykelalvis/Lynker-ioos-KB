# Formatting

[[InfrastructureBuilder]] has tried to keep the format of this vault reasonably consistent.

For tags that are not inline to text, we have a ` Tags:  ` text frontmatter (see above).

On pages with horizontal rules `---` at the bottom, IB will not modify anything below that line.  It would be a reasonable place for your changes so that a rebase might work smoothly.  All other changes to IB text are at your own risk.

All YAML Obsidian frontmatter should be left alone.
