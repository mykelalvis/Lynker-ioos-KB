Git
===

Git is a [[source code]] repository application written initially by Linus Torvalds as a replacement for a less-desirable source code repository that he was using previously.

Collections of source in git are referred to by name as a repository.  The name of such a repository can be defined a number of ways, but usually either as #TODO

Git is ostensibly a distributed source code repository system, although it is rarely used as such.  Every "clone" of a git repository is a full copy of all the history of that repository, and any clone can be used to update another clone.  In practice, most git work is done in a centralized fashion, using a service such as GitHub or BitBucket

# Services

There are numerous hosting services for git and other [[source code]] management systems such as Mercurial, Subversion, and Bazaar.

These services often provide additional adjunct services beyond just hosting the centralized repository, such as [[continuous integration|CI]]/[[continuous delivery|CD]] and [[release]] management capabilities.  Most of these additional services are designed to provide greater lock-in on the hosted code by facilitating the needs of the consumers.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a service that hosts Git repositories.  It was purchased by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) in 2018.  As of 2020, it had approximately 56 million users, making the largest such software hosting service in history.  It shows no signs of losing that title.

## BitBucket

[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) is a service similar to GitHub but owned and hosted by [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com)
